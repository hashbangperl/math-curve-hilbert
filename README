Math/Curve/Hilbert version 0.01
===============================

This is a Perl Implementation of Hilberts space filling Curve.

The Hilbert Curve module provides some useful functions using Hilberts Space-filling
Curve. This is handy for things like Dithering, Flattening n-dimensional data,
fractals - all kind of things really.

Interestingly David Hilbert thought of it way back in 1891 - 104 years before I started university, and
112 years before I started this module.

"A Space Filling Curve is a special fractal curve which has the following basic characteristics:
 ­ it covers completely an area, a volume or a hyper-volume in a 2-d, 3-d or N-d space respectively,
 ­ each point is visited once and only once (the curve does not cross itself), and
 ­ neighbor points in the native space are likely to be neighbors in the space filling curve."
definition from Multiple Range Query Optimization in Spatial Databases, Apostolos N. Papadopoulos and Yannis Manolopoulos

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module attempts to implement Hilberts curve in pure-perl, no modules should be
required, but some may be optional later to provide additional functionality or
improved performance.
